Redirection:
------------
standerd input, standerd output, standerd error are data stream and can flow from one place to another place. we can redirect these stram

1. redirecting standerd output:
-------------------------------
- it is associated with 1
- bydefault standerd output connected with terminal. but we can redirect this output from terminal to some where else based on our reqirement
- we can perform output redirection by using > and >> symbol

	------example-----
-to redirct standerd output of cat command from terminal to output.txt
	$ cat 1 > output.txt	or	cat > output.txt
	---some random data----
	-here the output in not show in terminal. here output show on output.txt and previous data in override

	$ cat 1 >> output.txt	or	cat >>	output.txt
	---some data to append----
	-here the data in appended to the output.txt file

2. Redirecting standerd error:
-------------------------------
-bydefault standerd error device is connected to terminal . we can redirect error massage from terminal to our requied place.
- we can implement error redirection by using > and >> symbols
- standerd error stram is associated with digit 2.
	------example------
	$ cal shfhwef 2>> error.txt
	-this command will generate error and append this error will be saved on error.txt file insted of terminal

3. Redirecting standard input:
------------------------------
- bydefault standerd input device in connected with keyboard. but we can redirect form keyboard to somewhere else based on our requirement.
- standerd input stream associted with  0
- we can perform input redirction by using < symbol.
	----example----
	$ cat 0< a.txt	  or	 cat < a.txt 	or cat a.txt
	- here cat will take input from a.txt file and not except it from keyboard and display output to the standerd output device which is terminal.

-bydefault < symbol is always associated with 0. hence we can remove
-if we not using any symbol with cat command, it will bydefault consider < symbol. so we not require to use < symbol also...

-------- read input from a.txt and write that output to result.txt and error into error.txt-------
$ cat 0< a.txt 1> result.txt 2>> error.txt
		or
$ cat a.txt > result.txt 2>> error.txt
-here
input redirection from keyboard to a.txt
output redirection from terminal to result.txt
error redirection from terminal to error.txt

que. ->how to output and error redirect to result.txt only
$ cat a.txt > result.txt 2>result.txt
	or
$ cat a.txt &> result.txt
-here if we use 
> and >> 	either output redirection or error redirection
&> 	both output and error redirection to a single place


- redirecting standerd output of one terminal to another terminal:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

-in unix every thingis treated as a file even our terminal also
- we can find terminal related file by using tty command.
-----------example------------
terminal one	/dev/pts/0
terminal two	/dev/pts/1

from first terminal to second terminal:
----------------------------------------
$ cal /dev/pts/1
	here we will get the cal output to the terminal no. two

que. in how many ways a command can get input?
que. which of the following are data stream?
standard input
	output
	error
que. bydefault standard input device connected to :  keyboard
que. standard output: terminal
que. standerd error: terminal

0--standard input stream
1--	 output stream
2--	 error stream

que. how we can redirect standard output of the ls command to a file called output.txt
	$ls > output.txt
	$ ls 1> output.txt
que. how we can redirect the standerd output of the ls command to output.txt but at the same time, redirect standard error to error.txt ?
	$ ls > output.txt 2> error.txt
que. what is diff between <,>,>> symbol
	< for input redirection
	> for output and error redirection where override will happen
	>> for output and error redirection where append will happen
