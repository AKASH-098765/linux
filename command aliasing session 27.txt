command aliasing
-------------------

-Aliasing is means giving a nickname to a perticular person or product for our understanding

-in linux, for the lenthy command we can give alias name for the simplicity.

- when we define alias it is store temparary

-how to create alias name:
-------------------------
$ alias nickname='original command'

how to list out all alias name:
-------------------------------
we have to use alias command
$ alias

how to remove alias name:
-----------------------
$ unalias command_name;

to remove all alias
$ unalias -a

how to check the alias name is already use or not:
--------------------------------------------------
$ type alias_name

where are the usecase of alias:
-------------------------------
1. if leanthy command repetedly required then we can create shortcut alise name and we can use that shortcut every time.
	-----example--------
mkdir dir1;touch dir1/file{1..20}.txt		----here we create dir dir1 and in that we create 20 file
$ alias d20f='mkdir dir1;touch dir1/file{1..20}.txt'

2. to use our home os commands in linux directly
	---example---
$ alias cls=clear
$ alias rename=mv

3. to handle typing mistake
 sometime we bymistake write wrong command for a perticular. in such case we can use the alias 

$ grep
$ grpe	--bymistake we type this
$ alias grpe=grep

4. To handle language barrier:
some country they use different word compair to our word

in germany date say as datum
$ alias datum=date


-alias are temporary stored in the system
-but we can store this alias permnantly in the system using .bash or c file

-1st way:
----------
.bashrc file inside user home directory and define their alias

	------example-------
if we want to use alias for clear as cls 
 -here first we go the user home dir and then open .bashrc file and here we create our own alias
 - after creating alias we save the file and then we will reopen the terminal or use this command
$ resource .bashrc

2nd way:
-----------
instead of editing .bashrc file we can create our own file to maintain our defined aliases.
the name of file should be .bash_aliases and should be present user home dir

$ gedit .bash_aliases

	alias mydate=date
	alias dd=date;date
	alias cls=clear
