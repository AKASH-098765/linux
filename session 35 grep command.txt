grep command and various option:
----------------------------------

search multiple content in file:
-------------------------------
$ grep -e 'java' -e 'linux' demo.txt	or	$ egrep '(java|linux)' demo.txt
	here we search for java and linux word  in demo.txt and give the whole line

egrep command can understand patterns
$ egrep '^linux' demo.txt
$ egrep '(java|linux)' demo.txt

que. we want the line which is start with 'java' 
$ grep -i '^java' demo.txt

grep with -F option:
-----------------
-it means fixed strings
-if we want to search for a group of fixed string then we should go for -F option

	-example-
$ grep -F "java
>python
>linux" demo.txt


here we can use fgrep insted of grep
fgrep means  --> Fixed String Globle Regular Expression Print

-fgrep command not understand pattern, it only understand string
-we have to provide only fixed string

	-------example------
we have some word in keyword.txt file and we want to search the word in another file of demo.txt
$ fgrep -f keyword.txt demo.txt
	here we will the the result of the word from keyword.txt into the demo.txt file



-performancewise fgrep is to good
-but egrep is too powerfull
-highly recommanded to use grep -f and grep -e
